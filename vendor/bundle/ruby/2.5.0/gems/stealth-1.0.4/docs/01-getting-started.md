## Ruby

Stealth has been tested on Ruby (MRI) `2.4.x` and `2.5.x`. While we don't require any C-based Ruby gems, we haven't yet certified Stealth on other VMs (such as JRuby).

## Installation

You can install Stealth via RubyGems:

  ```
  gem install stealth
  ```

Next, you can create a new Stealth bot:

  ```
  stealth new <bot_name>
  ```
